## Strategy for implementing 
Will create command line Application by using GoLang. and will also used othe rcommand line tools for getting benchmarks. like dd(IO), fast-cli(network), speedtest-cli(network), and 7z(for cpu). 
I will use Git for Code History(prefered Github). and will write all docs in `README.md` format.

In my experience, i have used so many languages. Java, Kotlin, Dart, Golang, Javascript, NodeJS, Typescript, Groovy for Gradle.
